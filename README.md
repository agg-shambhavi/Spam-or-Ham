# Spam-or-Ham
I have used the SMS Spam Collection Dataset. It contains the text of 5572 SMS messages and a label, classifying the message as "spam" or "ham". I have implemented Bag of Words from scratch and then I have used scikit learn's implementation of Bag of Words to transform the entire dataset. Further, I have used the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify the messages into "spam" or "ham".
